# HopScotch-
Enhancing Computational Thinking through
Interactive Hopscotch Game
Introduction:
In the modern educational landscape, fostering computational thinking skills among
young learners is paramount for their success in an increasingly digital world. This
project aims to achieve this goal by transforming the traditional hopscotch game into
an interactive digital platform that engages students in computational thinking
concepts.
Approach:
● To develop an educational game that enhances computational thinking skills
in young learners.
● Utilize the familiar framework of hopscotch to create an engaging and
interactive learning experience.
● Incorporate key computational thinking principles, including decomposition,
pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms.
● Provide varying levels of difficulty to accommodate learners of different skill
levels.
● The interactive hopscotch game consists of three main levels, each designed
to target specific computational thinking skills while maintaining the essence
of the traditional game.
